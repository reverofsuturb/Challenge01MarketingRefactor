#Challenge01MarketingRefactor

## Description

This is a project where code was supplied and refactored in order to ensure website accessibility, be written with semantic HTML elements, contain a logical structure, have the headings fall in sequential order, and a concise title for the website itself. While satisfying these conditions, I approached this from a lens of clarity, organization, and consolidation. You will see that the HTML follows a semantic style, the CSS has been paired down and is organized to cater to three areas, header, main, and aside.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The navigation links located in the header will take you to the appropriate sections of the website. If viewing the code be sure to read through the comments as they explain both changes and decisions made as part of this refactor. There is a link to the website in the about section of the repository, here is a link to a screenshot of the website: https://github.com/reverofsuturb/Challenge01MarketingRefactor/blob/9bc1ece9cf85b147c82c4511c08209dc15472267/RefactorScreenshot.PNG
